# Getting Started with Raid Codex and Raid Champ Guesser

In the Codex, you can filter by champion rarity (A-Z), race, faction, type, and affinity. 

The game starts with a 30 second timer. The goal is to guess correctly as many as you can while not guessing incorrectly. 
If you think you did well, you can send your score to the leaderboard which displays the top scores globally.
